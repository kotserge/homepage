                        On the side, I research artificial intelligence and information security,
                        and I enjoy learning all things related and unrelated to my field.

<h2>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</h2>
<p>PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS
&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
<p>&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).</p>
<p>&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
<p>&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
