We would like to point out that data transmission on the internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.

### Duration of storage

Unless a specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies.

### General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website

If you have given your consent for data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a) GDPR or Article 9 Paragraph 2 Letter a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Article 9 Paragraph 1 GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Article 49 Paragraph 1 Letter a) GDPR.

### Recipients of Personal Data

In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only share personal data with external parties when it is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, when we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., sharing data with tax authorities), when we have a legitimate interest in the transfer according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f GDPR, or when another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only share our customers' personal data based on a valid contract for data processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is established.

### Revocation of your consent to data processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

### Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Article 21 GDPR)

IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ARTICLE 6 PARAGRAPH 1 LETTER E) OR F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21 PARAGRAPH 1 GDPR).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 PARAGRAPH 2 GDPR).

### Right of complaint to the responsible supervisory authority

In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

### Right to data portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract to be handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.

### Disclosure, rectification and deletion

Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time for information free of charge about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.

### Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
- If you have lodged an objection pursuant by Article 21 Paragraph 1 GDPR, a weighing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

### SSL or TLS encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser search bar.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

### Request by e-mail, telephone or telefax

If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We will not pass on this data without your consent.

The processing of this data is based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b) GDPR, if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us (Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f) GDPR) or on your consent (Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.

The data you send to us via inquiries will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after we have completed processing your request).
